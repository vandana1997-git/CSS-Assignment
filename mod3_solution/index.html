<h2>Chciken</h2>
    <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals 
      such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.
Sushi: s a traditional Japanese dish made with vinegared rice (sushi-meshi), typically seasoned with sugar and salt, and combined with a
      variety of ingredients ( neta), such as seafood, vegetables, or meat: raw seafood is the most common, although some may be cooked. While sushi comes 
      in numerous styles and presentation, the defining component is the vinegared rice, also known as shari, or sumeshi
      The modern form of sushi is believed to have been created by Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, the most commonly recognized type today, in which seafood is 
      placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice. This innovation occurred around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). 
      It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.
Beef: Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying 
      degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds 
      of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high 
      environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.
      In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or 
      quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were 
      the largest producers of beef. Some religions and cultures prohibit beef consumption, especially Indian religions like Hinduism. Buddhists are also against animal slaughtering, but they do not have a wrongful eating doctrine.</p>
